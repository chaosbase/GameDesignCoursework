- To run or build this unity project, install **Multiplayer HLAPI** with package manager ( ,which is in **window > Package manager** in Unity editor). 
- And check if both scenes(first the **Scenes/lobby**, and second the **Scenes/playground**) are added into **File > build settings > Scenes in build**.
